# Why this Project?

I know that this project will not be profitable , But, I wanted to make this project as :-

1. I am bored

3. There is no product in the market that is like this

# Components List

2. A LCD (I have not actually picked one as of now)
3. A LiPo (I need to do some estimations)
4. A PCB (Designs will be posted here when they are done)
5. A Case (Same as the PCB's status)

# TODO

1. Start work on the custom fork of Android
2. Decide the actual components
3. Artwork
4. Case Design
5. PCBs
6. Make the custom version of TachiDesk
7. Ask Tamanash to help with the react native browser thing , or it will be replaced by firefox
